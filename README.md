# CompTIA-Cybersecurity-Analyst-CySA- Certification Exam Objectives

## Threat and Vulnerability Management

Explain the importance of threat data and intelligence.

Cybersecurity professionals are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information and systems maintained by their
organizations. Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able
to gain access to sensitive information. Integrity ensures that there are no
unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or
unintentionally. Availability ensures that information and systems are ready to
meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them. Together,
these three goals are known as the CIA Triad.

As cybersecurity analysts seek to protect their organizations, they must evaluate
risks to the CIA Triad. This includes identifying vulnerabilities, recognizing
corresponding threats, and determining the level of risk that results from
vulnerability and threat combinations. Analysts must then evaluate each risk and
identify appropriate risk management strategies to mitigate or otherwise address
the risk.

Cybersecurity analysts mitigate risks using security controls designed to reduce
the likelihood or impact of a risk. Network security controls include network
access control (NAC) systems, firewalls, and network segmentation. Secure
endpoint controls include hardened system configurations, patch management,
Group Policies, and endpoint security software.
Penetration tests and reverse engineering provide analysts with the reassurance
that the controls they’ve implemented to mitigate risks are functioning properly.
By following a careful risk analysis and control process, analysts significantly
enhance the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and
systems under their control

## The three objectives of cybersecurity are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 

Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to
gain access to sensitive information. Integrity ensures that there are no
unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or
unintentionally. Availability ensures that information and systems are ready to
meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them.

## Cybersecurity risks result from the combination of a threat and a vulnerability. 

A vulnerability is a weakness in a device, system, application, or
process that might allow an attack to take place. A threat in the world of
cybersecurity is an outside force that may exploit a vulnerability.

## Cybersecurity threats may be categorized as adversarial, accidental, structural, or environmental. 

Adversarial threats are individuals, groups, and organizations that are attempting to 
deliberately undermine the security of an organization. Accidental threats occur 
when individuals doing their routine work mistakenly perform an action that undermines security. 
Structural threats occur when equipment, software, or environmental controls fail due to 
the exhaustion of resources, exceeding their operational capability or simply failing due to age.
Environmental threats occur when natural or man-made disasters occur that are
outside the control of the organization.

## Networks are made more secure through the use of network access control, firewalls, and segmentation. 

Network access control (NAC) solutions help
security professionals achieve two cybersecurity objectives: limiting network
access to authorized individuals and ensuring that systems accessing the
organization’s network meet basic security requirements. Network firewalls sit
at the boundaries between networks and provide perimeter security. Network
segmentation uses isolation to separate networks of differing security levels from
each other.

## Endpoints are made more secure through the use of hardened configurations, patch management, ## Group Policy, and endpoint security software. 

Hardening configurations includes disabling any unnecessary services
on the endpoints to reduce their susceptibility to attack, ensuring that secure
configuration settings exist on devices and centrally controlling device security
settings. Patch management ensures that operating systems and applications are
not susceptible to known vulnerabilities. Group Policy allows the application of
security settings to many devices simultaneously, and endpoint security software
protects against malicious software and other threats.

## Penetration tests provide organizations with an attacker’s perspective on their security. 

The NIST process for penetration testing divides tests into four
phases: planning, discovery, attack, and reporting. The results of penetration
tests are valuable security planning tools, since they describe the actual
vulnerabilities that an attacker might exploit to gain access to a network.

## Reverse engineering techniques attempt to determine how hardware and software functions internally. 

Sandboxing is an approach used to detect
malicious software based on its behavior rather than its signatures. Other reverse
engineering techniques are difficult to perform, are often unsuccessful, and are
quite time-consuming.
